# Intro

Welcome to my personal portfolio. After working for more than four years as a Data Scientist I have quite a few projects I could use to showcase my abilities in this field. The problem is that it is difficult to present those projects in this portfolio without exposing sensitive information from the companies I have been working for. Therefore, I decided to start working on personal mini projects that I could use to show you a little bit about me. 

In this web site I will be posting all my projects. Note that only a brief description of the project will be posted here. You will find a link to my **GitHub** repositories where you will find all the code and a more detailed explanation about each project. 

# Projects

## Idealista

This is the first project of my personal portfolio. [idealista.com](https://www.idealista.com) is one of the most popular real state website that Spanish people use to trade properties in Spain. The goal here is to explore the housing market in my home city (Cádiz - Spain). I thought that this project could be interesting because it implies four key skills in Data science, web scraping, data cleansing, exploratory data analysis and a bit of machine learning. My goal then is to obtain data, clean and structure it, get insights and train an ML model able to predict the price of a property based on its characteristics. This project is divided in four sections:

* [Data extraction via web scraping](https://github.com/estmelra/idealista/blob/main/scraper.ipynb)
* [Data cleaning and preparation](https://github.com/estmelra/idealista/blob/main/data_preparation.ipynb)
* [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://google.com](http://nbviewer.org/github/estmelra/idealista/blob/main/eda.ipynb)
* Machine Learning Regression model to estimate property price
