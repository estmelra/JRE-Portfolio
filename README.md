Intro

Welcome to my personal portfolio. After working for more than four years as a Data Scientist I have quite a few projects I could use to showcase my abilities in this field. The problem is that it is difficult to present those projects in this portfolio without exposing sensitive information from the companies I have been working for. Therefore, I decided to start working on personal mini projects that I could use to show you a little bit about me. 

In this web site I will be posting all my projects. Note that only a brief description of the project will be posted here. You will find a link to my **GitHub** repositories where you will find all the code and a more detailed explanation about each project. 

# Projects

## Idealista
This is the first project of my personal portfolio. [idealista.com](https://www.idealista.com) is one of the most popular real state website that Spanish people use to trade properties in Spain. The goal here is to explore the housing market in my home city (Cádiz - Spain). I thought that this project could be interesting because it implies four key skills in Data science, web scraping, data cleansing, exploratory data analysis and a bit of machine learning. My goal then is to obtain data, clean and structure it, get insights and train an ML model able to predict the price of a property based on its characteristics.




# Portfolio intro

Welcome to the first mini project of my personal portfolio where I create a web scraper to obtain valuable information from Idealista. When structuring my portfolio I thought that a good Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was the first thing I needed to do in order to showcase my abilities. After searching for a messy dataset I could work with for some time I decided to create my own scraper to obtain data for my analysis. So this project will be divided into tree parts:

* [Data extraction via web scraping](https://github.com/estmelra/idealista/blob/main/scraper.ipynb)
* Data cleaning and preparation
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Machine Learning Regression model to estimate property price


# Why idealista?

Well idealista is one of the main real state platforms that Spanish people use to sell and buy houses. After having worked as a data scientist for more than three years I have finished plenty of projects but it is difficult to use them for my portfolio without revealing sensitive information about the companies I have been working for. Therefore, I decided to develop a study about the real state situation at my home city (Cadiz) that I could maybe benefit from. Also, idealista website is a relatively easy site to scrap and data is not really well-structured (I wanted to start my EDA with messy data as data cleansing is also a big part of data science).
