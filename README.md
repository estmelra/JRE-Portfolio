# Portfolio intro

Welcome to the first mini project of my personal portfolio where I create a web scraper to obtain valuable information from Idealista. When structuring my portfolio I thought that a good Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was the first thing I needed to do in order to showcase my abilities. After searching for a messy dataset I could work with for some time I decided to create my own scraper to obtain data for my analysis. So this project will be divided into tree parts:

- Data extraction via web scraping 
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning Regression model to estimate house price


# Why idealista?

Well idealista is one of the main real state platforms that Spanish people use to sell and buy houses. After having worked as a data scientist for more than three years I have finished plenty of projects but it is difficult to use them for my portfolio without revealing sensitive information about the companies I have been working for. Therefore, I decided to develop a study about the real state situation at my home city (Cadiz) that I could maybe benefit from. Also, idealista website is a relatively easy site to scrap and data is not really well-structured (I wanted to start my EDA with messy data as data cleansing is also a big part of data science).
